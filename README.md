**Lenson Wandie – Software Developer**
Welcome to my domain! This portfolio is a collection of my work as a developer and digital architect, where I bring creative and technical visions to life.

**About Me:**
To the outside world, I am a software engineer, designing and building websites and interactive applications. But in my world, I am an artist. I envision, manifest, design, and bring ideas to life. I see my projects at their atomic state—lines of code and raw data—then craft them into something tangible and functional.
The joy of seeing a project come to life, from blueprint to reality, is profound. As an architect, I design the structure; as an engineer, I breathe life into it. My work is not just about programming—it’s about creation, innovation, and expression.
I am a spirited developer. Welcome to my domain!
